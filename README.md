🧠 The Tech Behind The Magic
What's the secret behind our predictions? The answer is Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), a Machine Learning model we've trained using two powerful analytical approaches:

Fundamental Analysis (Long-Term): We look at the company's "health" (financial statements, balance sheets, etc.) to predict its potential price growth over the next few quarters. Think of it as checking a building's foundation before buying.

Technical Analysis (Short-Term): We analyze historical price patterns, volume, and other indicators to forecast price movements over the next few days. This is like reading a weather map to predict tomorrow's rain.

By combining both, we give you a more comprehensive view.

📜 A Wise Reminder
"In God we trust. All others must bring data."

— W. Edwards Deming
