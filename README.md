## 🧠 The Tech Behind The Magic

What's the secret behind our predictions? The answer is **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**, a Machine Learning model we've trained using two powerful analytical approaches:

* **Fundamental Analysis (Long-Term)**: We look at the company's "health" (financial statements, balance sheets, etc.) to predict its potential price growth over the next few quarters. Think of it as checking a building's foundation before buying.

* **Technical Analysis (Short-Term)**: We analyze historical price patterns, volume, and other indicators to forecast price movements over the next few days. This is like reading a weather map to predict tomorrow's rain.

By combining both, we give you a more comprehensive view.
